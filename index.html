        <h3>Welcome to Hangar Database!</h3>
        <p>What is this site?</p>
        <p>Here you will find a wide assortment of stunning pictures from the most important aircraft that made history.
          I dedicated this Blog/Gallery space for one of my biggest passions: self propelled flying machines!
          This does not only include planes, but Helicopters, Gyrocopters, Airships (or blimps as they are commonly referred to) as well.

        <p>From Piston to Jet powered aircraft, single engine biplanes to bombers powered by multiple egines,
           you will find a gallery dedicated to the beasts that conquered the air, with focus on military and historical aircraft.</p>
        <h3>Aircraft can be classified as the following:</h3>
        <h3>Fixed-Wing</h3>
        <p>The first heavier-than-air craft capable of controlled free-flight were gliders. A glider designed by George Cayley carried out the first true manned, controlled flight in 1853. The first powered and controllable fixed-wing aircraft (the airplane or aeroplane) was invented by Wilbur and Orville Wright.

          Besides the method of propulsion (if any), fixed-wing aircraft are in general characterized by their wing configuration. The most important wing characteristics are:
          
             <ul>
              <li>Number of wings — Monoplane, biplane, triplane, or multiplane.</li>
              <li>Wing support — Braced or cantilever, rigid or flexible.</li>
              <li>Wing planform — including aspect ratio, angle of sweep, and any variations along the span (including the important class of delta wings).</li>
              <li>Location of the horizontal stabilizer, if any.</li>
              <li>Dihedral angle — positive, zero, or negative (anhedral).</li>
             </ul>

          A variable geometry aircraft can change its wing configuration during flight.
          
          A flying wing has no fuselage, though it may have small blisters or pods. The opposite of this is a lifting body, which has no wings, though it may have small stabilizing and control surfaces.
          
          Wing-in-ground-effect vehicles are generally not considered aircraft.[12] They "fly" efficiently close to the surface of the ground or water, like conventional aircraft during takeoff. An example is the Russian ekranoplan nicknamed the "Caspian Sea Monster". Man-powered aircraft also rely on ground effect to remain airborne with minimal pilot power, but this is only because they are so underpowered—in fact, the airframe is capable of flying higher. </p>
          <h3>Rotorcraft</h3>
          <p>Rotorcraft, or rotary-wing aircraft, use a spinning rotor with aerofoil cross-section blades (a rotary wing) to provide lift. Types include helicopters, autogyros, and various hybrids such as gyrodynes and compound rotorcraft.

            Helicopters have a rotor turned by an engine-driven shaft. The rotor pushes air downward to create lift. By tilting the rotor forward, the downward flow is tilted backward, producing thrust for forward flight. Some helicopters have more than one rotor and a few have rotors turned by gas jets at the tips. Some have a tail rotor to counteract the rotation of the main rotor, and to aid directional control.
            
            Autogyros have unpowered rotors, with a separate power plant to provide thrust. The rotor is tilted backward. As the autogyro moves forward, air blows upward across the rotor, making it spin. This spinning increases the speed of airflow over the rotor, to provide lift. Rotor kites are unpowered autogyros, which are towed to give them forward speed or tethered to a static anchor in high-wind for kited flight.
            
            Compound rotorcraft have wings that provide some or all of the lift in forward flight. They are nowadays classified as powered lift types and not as rotorcraft. Tiltrotor aircraft (such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey), tiltwing, tail-sitter, and coleopter aircraft have their rotors/propellers horizontal for vertical flight and vertical for forward flight. </p>
          <h3>Other methods of lift</h3>
          <p>    A lifting body is an aircraft body shaped to produce lift. If there are any wings, they are too small to provide significant lift and are used only for stability and control. 
            Lifting bodies are not efficient: they suffer from high drag, and must also travel at high speed to generate enough lift to fly. Many of the research prototypes, such as the Martin Marietta X-24, which led up to the Space Shuttle, were lifting bodies, though the Space Shuttle is not, and some supersonic missiles obtain lift from the airflow over a tubular body.
            Powered lift types rely on engine-derived lift for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL). 
            Most types transition to fixed-wing lift for horizontal flight. 
            Classes of powered lift types include VTOL jet aircraft (such as the Harrier jump jet) and tiltrotors, such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, among others. A few experimental designs rely entirely on engine thrust to provide lift throughout the whole flight, including personal fan-lift hover platforms and jetpacks. VTOL research designs include the Rolls-Royce Thrust Measuring Rig.
            Some rotor wings employ horizontal-axis wings, in which airflow across a spinning rotor generates lift. The Flettner airplane uses a rotating cylinder, obtaining lift from the Magnus effect. The FanWing uses a cross-flow fan, while the mechanically more complex cyclogyro comprises multiple wings which rotate together around a central axis.
            The ornithopter obtains thrust by flapping its wings.</p>
